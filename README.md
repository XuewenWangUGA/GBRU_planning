# gbru_planning
Planning of ongoing projects at Genome and Bioinformatic Reseach Unit of USDA.
- Peanut pan-genome project
-[x] Diploid genome assembly of AduK30060
-[x] Pan-genome graph construction from multiple genomes
-[x] Viewing graph and mapping specificity
-[] Pan-genome graph performance with simulated reads mapping
   1) 250 bp or longer reads: specific
   2) 150 bp reads: checking
-[] Analysis of real introgression lines with pan-genome graph

-Synthetic tetraploid peanut project
-[x] Sequencing and genome assembly of synthetic tetraploid IpaDur
-[] Gene conversion identification

-Soybean genome project
-[x] Asssembly of diploid genomes of G.max and G.soja
-[x] Comprison of soybean genomes
  1) Compared with G. max Wm82, G.soja PI483463, great improvement of genome assembly
  2) Finalizing inversions in Chr19
-[] Pan-genome construction of Soybean genomes
